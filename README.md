Unit 1 Lesson 3 - Modelling a Band

This program seeks to demonstrate basic understanding and functionality for classes, methods, and attributes. 
There are three simple functionalities that this program should display as per the lesson: 

1. You should be able to hire and fire bands
2. The Drummer should countdown from 4
3. After countdown the Band should all start playing their solos (Drummer, Guitarist, & Bassist)

I've added additional functionality to make the program more user friendly. Running the program will trigger a series of logical questions that will enable you to hire and fire bands, the drummer will only countdown once you've hired the band, and the subsequent solo's will onlybe "played" post countdown.
